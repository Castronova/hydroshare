Vagrant to build a local virtual box

See docs/Developing using VirtualBox and Vagrant.docx
for a more detailed description.

This vagrant file is configured to use a SHARED directory.
Basically, if you change something in here it changes on the virtual machine.
use this directory as it's hydroshare

===== INSTALL ==
If you have not installed virtual box yet, go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
  Install BOTH the VirtualBox platform packages, and the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. 
  The virtual box is configured to allow for RDP access

If you have not installed Vagrant yet, go to http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Optional developement environment: install Jetbrains PhPStorm

=== LOCAL CONFIGURATION: ===
On the workstation/desktop/latop that you have installed virtual box:
add to hosts file. 
127.0.0.1	hydroshare.local phpmyadmin

== settings file ==
cp sites/default/settings.php.hydroshare sites/default/settings.php


=== RUNNING HYDROSHARE via vagrant== 
=== JetBrains PhpStorm (beta 138.91 or greater )
Tools>Vagant
=== command line

$ vagrant up
after a set of changes you will see:
----
 Stderr from the command:
  stdin: is not a tty
  Process finished with exit code 1
----
Then the machine is ready.
  
Afterwards you may access your box with

$ vagrant ssh

=== SEEING THE WEBSITES ===
Configured proxy to run on 7777
http://hydroshare.local:7777/install.php
http://phpmyadmin:7777/

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ==
---
Vagrant up says:
  Stderr from the command:
  stdin: is not a tty
  Process finished with exit code 1

ignore
---

I am asked to install drupal:
   You have not copied over settings file, and drupal is installing a complete new instance (this is being worked on).
   cp sites/default/settings.php.hydroshare sites/default/settings.php

=====================================
Notes for Windows Development
-----------------------------

If you are working with a Windows host, you want the shared directory to use Unix line endings.
Do that by configuring this git repository as follows::

    $ git config core.eol lf
    $ git config core.autocrlf input

You will probably also need to `git reset --hard` to re-extract all files with approproate line endings.
Do this *before* proceeding with bootstrapping.




=== TO DOS ===
* This starts with the pre-configured site. Need a clean Hydroshare profile.
** the profiles/hydroshare is the start of this
*** the sites/all/modules/hydroshare/hydroshare_tweaks is a modules that will have all the important dependencies.
** profile needs to have start data. Can be done using drush, or a set of curl scrips.
