Notes for Windows Development
-----------------------------

If you are working with a Windows host, you want the shared directory to use Unix line endings.
Do that by configuring this git repository as follows::

    $ git config core.eol lf
    $ git config core.autocrlf input

You will probably also need to `git reset --hard` to re-extract all files with approproate line endings.
Do this *before* proceeding with bootstrapping.
