# Hydroshare
HydroShare is a collaborative website being developed for better access to data and models in the hydrologic sciences. HydroShare will provide the sustainable technology infrastructure needed to address critical issues related to water quantity, quality, accessibility, and management. HydroShare will expand the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated, expanding capability to include the sharing of models and model components, and taking advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models.

## Developing for Drupal
Drupal contains an extensive API that allows you to add to and modify the functionality of your site. The API consists of "hooks", which allow modules to react to system events and customize Drupal's behavior, and functions that standardize common operations such as database queries and form generation. The flexible hook architecture means that you should never need to directly modify the files that come with Drupal core to achieve the functionality you want; instead, functionality modifications take the form of modules.

When you need new functionality for your Drupal site, search for existing contributed modules. If you find a module that matches except for a bug or an additional needed feature, change the module and contribute your improvements back to the project in the form of a "patch". Create new custom modules only when nothing existing comes close to what you need.
